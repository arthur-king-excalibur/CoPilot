**CoPilot** is a fully responsive admin template that is forked from [AdminLTE](https://almsaeedstudio.com). The difference here is that this repo is tailored to use with vue.js. The UI is based on the [Bootstrap 3](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap) framework. Highly customizable and easy to use. Fits many screen resolutions from small mobile devices to large desktops.

The structure of the app is scaffolded by [vue-cli](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli). Which is a simple CLI tool that setups our environment. CoPilot uses the webpack package. So we get a full-featured Webpack + vue-loader setup with hot reload, linting, testing & css extraction.

We leverage all the goodies that vue.js offers. Vue-Router for routing. Vue-Resource for AJAX calls. Vuex for state management.

I also recommend that you install vue-devtools for Chrome so that you can easily inspect that state of vue.
